# FPGA_Signal_Processing_Development
The complete Verilog RTL code used within the FPGA Signal Processing Development Final Year Project

The Verilog RTL files given here are for the HDL implementation of the high-frequency digitalisation board (HFDB) designed as part of Renas Ercan's BEng final year project. 
The RTL files are intended for the 8KHz frequency channel of the FPGA design.

The files given here include the HFDB input text file as well as the Sine and Cos LUT input text files.

To replicate the results obtained in the project it is recommended that Quartus is used for the opening, designing, compiling and simulation of this code. It is recommended that ModelSim is used to run the code with the testbench provided.

I hereby retain all rights to this source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from this code without express permission.
